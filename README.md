# Tic-Tac-Toe
It's a ultimate C++ program to run a Tic-Tac-Toe game and show loading percentage(1-100) to start the game, it has 2 modes of playing whether player vs player OR player vs computer.
For 2 players mode it will directly take the input from users on which position they want to mark and directly add their mark in the game sheet.
For 1 player vs Computer mode it will take input from user and for computer turn it will use a random function and will check wheather the number is repeated or not, if repeated it will call the random function again and take new value as the computer mark.
